Subject: Application for JavaScript Developer

I am writing to express my strong interest in the Junior JavaScript Developer position. With my experience and passion for programming and web application development, I am confident in my ability to make a positive contribution to your team.

I am currently a final-year student in business informatics. Due to my strong desire to acquire new knowledge and further improve the skills I have gained through previous internships, projects, and studies, I believe I am an excellent candidate for this position.

I have dedicated significant attention to continuously learning JavaScript, which has provided me with a solid foundation for more efficiently mastering the React library and its key concepts, such as state management, the use of props, and component architecture, as well as working with various libraries like Axios and React Router DOM. Additionally, I have worked with Node.js and Express, where I gained experience in creating RESTful APIs and working with MongoDB databases. I believe this knowledge greatly contributes to my understanding of the overall web application development process, and I am eager to continue learning and growing in this area.

I am communicative, persistent, and resourceful. I easily and willingly engage in communication with others because I believe that mutual respect and understanding are the foundation for good teamwork, which is essential for successful operations. I view any challenges that arise as opportunities to learn.

Thank you for your attention, and I look forward to the opportunity to discuss in more detail how my skills can contribute to your team. Attached you will find my CV. I am available for an interview and can be reached via phone or email.

Kind regards,
Filip Orčić
